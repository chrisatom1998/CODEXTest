# Tetris Android

This is a minimal Tetris implementation written in Kotlin for Android.
It is intended to be opened with Android Studio. The project contains a
basic game loop and touch controls (tap in the center to rotate, tap left
or right to move). Pieces fall automatically every half second.

## How to run

1. Open Android Studio and choose **Open an existing project**.
2. Select the `tetris-android` directory.
3. Let Gradle sync and build the project.
4. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

This implementation is intentionally simple and may require additional
work for production use (such as scoring, sounds, and more complex input
handling).
